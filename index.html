               The Inventory Fraud Project is developed by a team of researchers at UC Davis. The goal of this project is to shed new light on the journey of an ad across the digital advertising supply chain. Our study is focused around adexchange-prohibited inventory that obtain digital advertising and the entities involved in routing the ads to these websites. This enables us to study the compliance of adtech standards and detect inventory misrepresentation-based fraudulent instances. As part of our research, we plan to measure and inform affected buyers and sellers (where appropriate) in order to reduce ad inventory fraud within the ad-tech ecosystem.
               <!--As part of our research, we periodically crawl the problematic websites and associated ad-tech standards (<em>ads.txt</em> & <em>sellers.json</em>) to understand the entities involved in advertising on such websites. Aim is to study the compliance of the ad-tech standards, detect inventory misrepresentation based fraudulent instances, and appropriately inform the affected as well as involved entities in an attempt to reduce the Ad Inventory Fraud in the advertising ecosystem. -->
